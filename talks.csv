1,Jenny,Salinasan,MS31: Matrix decompositions and applications,The $\phi_S$ polar decomposition when $S$ is skew-symmetric,"Let $F$ be a field with characteristic not equal to $2$, and $S \in M_{2n}(F)$ be skew-symmetric $(S^{\top}=-S)$ and nonsingular.
Let $\phi_S$ be the function defined by $\phi_S(A)=S^{-1}A^{\top}S$ for all $A \in M_{2n}(F)$.
Suppose $A \in M_{2n}(F)$.
We say that $A$ is $\phi_S$-orthogonal if $A$ is nonsingular and $\phi_S(A)=A^{-1}$; and $A$ is $\phi_S$-symmetric if $\phi_S(A)=A$.
We say that $A$ has a $\phi_S$ polar decomposition if $A=XY$ for some $\phi_S$-orthogonal $X \in M_{2n}(F)$ and $\phi_S$-symmetric $Y\in M_{2n}(F)$. 
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an $X \in M_{2n}(F)$ to have a $\phi_S$ polar decomposition."

$k$-tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices, $T^{(k)}_n$, where $n=km+s$ and $\det(T^{(1)}_p)=0$ for $p<m$. This factorization allows for the derivation of recursion expressions and provides a classification of singular Toeplitz matrices."
5,Hung-Yuan,Fan,MS11: Structured matrix computations and its applications,Inheritance properties of conjugate discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations,"In this talk we consider a class of conjugate discrete-time Riccati equations, arising originally from the linear quadratic regulator problem for discrete-time antilinear systems. Under mild and reasonable assumptions, the existence of the maximal solution to the conjugate discrete-time Riccati equation, in which the control weighting matrix is nonsingular and its constant term is Hermitian, will be inherited to a transformed discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation. Based on this inheritance property, an accelerated fixed-point iteration is proposed for finding the maximal solution via the transformed Riccati equation. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the correctness of our theoretical results and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm."
6,Shinya,Miyajima,MS1: Embracing new opportunities in numerical linear algebra,Some norm bounds on the complimentary error matrix functions,"Let $A \in \mathbf{C}^{n \times n}$ be a square matrix such that ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$, where $\sigma(A)$ is the spectrum of $A$. 
The error matrix function ${\rm erf}(A)$ and complimentary error matrix function ${\rm erfc}(A)$, which are introduced in \cite{Cortes}, are defined as 
$$
{\rm erf}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{1} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv \quad \mbox{and} \quad {\rm erfc}(A) := \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{1}^{\infty} e^{-(Av)^{2}} dv,
$$
respectively. 

One of the most important application of the complimentary error matrix function is the solution to systems of partial differential equation. 
Let $u_0, u(x,t) \in \mathbf{C}^n$. 
It is proven in \cite{Cortes} that the solution to semi-finite coupled diffusion problem 
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_{t} &=& A^2u_{xx}, \ x>0, \ t>0, \\
u(x,0) &=& 0, \ x>0, \quad 
u(0,t) = u_{0}, \ t>0, \quad 
u(x,t) \to 0, \ \textrm{as} \ x\rightarrow\infty, \ t > 0
\end{eqnarray*}
can be represented by using the complimentary error matrix function as follows:
$$
u(x,t) = {\rm erfc}\left(\frac{A^{-1}x}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)u_{0}, \quad x>0, \quad t>0. 
$$

Analogously to the scaler case, the functions ${\rm erf}(A)$ and ${\rm erfc}(A)$ satisfy the property ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, where $I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix. 
According to the Taylor expansion of $e^{-(Av)^{2}}$ where $v \in [0,1]$, and integrating term by term, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erf}(A) = \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}, 
$$
which is the Taylor expansion of ${\rm erf}(A)$ \cite{Cortes}. 
From this expansion and ${\rm erf}(A) + {\rm erfc}(A) = I$, we obtain 
$$
{\rm erfc}(A) = I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}. 
$$
In \cite{Cortes}, an upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under the condition ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$ has been derived as a corollary of the fact that ${\rm erfc}(A)$ is well-defined. 

The purpose of this talk is to present the following norm bounds: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a new upper bound on $\|{\rm erfc}(A)\|_2$ under a condition which is different from ${\rm Re}(\lambda) > |{\rm Im}(\lambda)|$, $\forall \lambda \in \sigma(A)$, 
\item upper bounds on $\|{\rm erf}(A) - {\rm erf}(B)\|_2$ and $\|{\rm erfc}(A) - {\rm erfc}(B)\|_2$, where $B \in \mathbf{C}^{n \times n}$, under an assumption, and 
\item upper bounds on 
$$
\left\|{\rm erf}(A) - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^k A^{2k}}{k! (2k+1)}\right\|_2 \ \mbox{and} \ 
\left\|{\rm erfc}(A) - \left(I - \frac{2A}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^kA^{2k}}{k!(2k+1)}\right)\right\|_2,
$$ 
where $m$ is a nonnegative integer, under an assumption. 
\end{itemize}
We report results of numerical experiments in order to observe how much larger the presented bounds are compared to the corresponding norms. 
This talk is based on the joint work with Prof. Amir Sadeghi in Islamic Azad University.

7,Hareshkumar,Jadav,Contributed talk,Generalizing Wilf's inequality for strongly regular graphs,"The clique number $\omega$ is the size of the largest clique in any graph. Determining the clique number is an NP-complete problem, which implies that there is no polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. Wilf's inequality provides a spectral bound for the clique number of simple graphs, given by $\frac{n}{n - \lambda_{1}} \leq \omega$, where $\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, and $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Strengthening this bound, Elphick and Wocjan proposed a conjecture in 2018 that is $\frac{n}{n - \sqrt{s^{+}}} \leq \omega$, where $s^+ = \sum_{\lambda_{i} > 0} \lambda_{i}^2$ and $\lambda_i$ are eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In this work, we have settled this conjecture for seven different classes of graphs: (1) Paley graphs which are strongly regular graphs with parameters $srg(4\beta + 1, 2\beta, \beta - 1, \beta)$, where $q$ is a prime power and $q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$; (2) strongly regular graphs with $\alpha = \beta$ (i.e., $srg(n, d, \beta, \beta)$); (3) the line graph of $K_{m,m}$; (4) the line graph of $K_{n}$; (5) the Cartesian product of strongly regular graphs $G$ with $G$, where $G$ is a strongly regular graph; (6) general Rook's graphs; and (7) Ramanujan graphs, where the second largest eigenvalue follows the property $\lambda_2 \leq 2\sqrt{d-1}$."
8,Sing-Yuan,Yeh,MS20: Manifold learning and statistical applications,Landmark diffusion accelerates alternating diffusion maps for multi-sensor fusion,"Alternating Diffusion (AD) is a commonly applied diffusion-based sensor fusion algorithm. While it has been successfully applied to various problems, its computational burden remains limited. Inspired by the landmark diffusion idea considered in the Robust and Scalable Embedding via Landmark Diffusion (ROSELAND), we propose a variation of AD, called Landmark AD (LAD), which captures the essence of AD while offering superior computational efficiency. Through a series of theoretical analyses, we investigate the sample complexity of LAD within the manifold setup. We then apply LAD to address the automatic sleep stage annotation problem using two electroencephalogram channels, demonstrating its efficacy in practical applications."
9,Tian-Xiao,He,MS25: Enumerative/algebraic combinatorics and matrices,High-order eulerian numbers and matrices,We study the properties of the higher-order Eulerian numbers and the higher-order Eulerian matrices. The row generating functions and the row sums of the higher-order Eulerian matrices are given. We also define higher-order Eulerian fractions and their alternative forms. Some properties of higher-order Eulerian fractions are expressed using differentials and integrals. The inversion relationships between second-order Eulerian numbers and Stirling numbers of the second and first kinds are given. We also give exact expressions for the entries of higher-order Eulerian matrices.
10,Yuki,Nishida,Contributed talk,Comparison of several schemes for the CSR expansion of max-plus matrices,"Max-plus algebra is a semiring with addition $a\oplus b := \max(a,b)$ and $a\otimes b := a+b$. The CSR expansion of a max-plus square matrix $A$ is a decomposition of the matrix power $A^{\otimes t}$ into the sum of matrices of the forms $C \otimes S^{\otimes t} \otimes R$, where $S$ is a permutation matrix. Several schemes for the CSR expansion have been introduced, such as Nachtigall (1997), Hartmann-Arguelles (1999) and Merlet et al.~(2014). In Nishida (2025), the author proposes a new scheme for the CSR expansion based on the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of a max-plus matrix. In this study, we compare the CSR expansions given by these schemes from the viewpoint of the transient bound, which is the minimum exponent $t$ such that the expansion is valid, and the number of terms in the expansion."
11,Amin,Faghih,MS23: Advances in Krylov subspace methods and their applications,Krylov subspaces and Sobolev functions,"In this talk, we will discuss how to generate Sobolev rational functions that are orthonormal with respect to a discrete Sobolev inner product through a long recurrence relation. The recurrence coefficients of this relation can be stored in a Hessenberg pencil. Two important numerical methods are those based on Krylov subspace methods and those based on restoring matrix structures. The methods are based on the connection between Sobolev orthonormal rational functions and the orthonormal bases for rational Krylov subspaces generated by a Jordan-like matrix."
12,Wasin,So,Contributed talk,Formal orthogonal systems,"Dreaming of an effective way to generate orthogonal bases in ${\bf R}^n$, 
we study  formal orthogonal systems which are  collections of nonzero $n \times n$  real matrices 
\[ \{A_0=I_n, A_1, A_2, \ldots,A_{n-1}\}\]
such that $\{A_0x, A_1x,A_2x,\cdots,A_{n-1}x\}$
 is an orthogonal set for all $x$ in ${\bf R}^n$. We prove that 
 formal orthogonal systems of order $n$ exist if and only if $n=1, 2,4,$ or  $8$.
 The proof has an unexpected connection to the famous results of Adolf Hurwitz
  on the product of two sums of $n$ squares.

13,Fernando,De Terán,Plenary talk,The canonical form for congruence: some history and applications,"A square matrix $A$ can be either seen as a linear map or as a bilinear form. When considered as a linear map, it is natural to introduce the relation of ``similarity'', $P^{-1}AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is a change of basis that allows us to represent the linear map in a simpler form, in particular in the well-known ``Jordan canonical form''. When considering the matrix $A$ as a bilinear form, the natural relation instead is the one of ``congruence'', $P^\top AP$ (with $P$ invertible), which is the suitable change of basis for bilinear forms. Is there a canonical form for such a relation? The answer is yes, and actually some different canonical forms for congruence have been introduced over the years since the 1930's. In this talk I will introduce the most recent one (by Horn and Sergeichuk, 2006), review the history of this and the other canonical forms, and show some applications in the context of my past and current research, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution of the equation $AX+X^\top A=0$ and its connection to $\top$-palindromic pencils.
    \item The consistency of the equation $X^\top AX=B$ when $B$ is either symmetric or skew-symmetric.
\end{itemize}"
14,Fernando,De Terán,"MS5: Advances in matrix equations: Theory, computations, and applications",The uniqueness of solution of systems of generalized Sylvester and $\star$-Sylvester equations,"The {\em generalized Sylvester equation}
$$
AXB-CXD=E
$$
has been a subject of interest since, at least, the early 20th century. More recently, the {\em$\star$-generalized Sylvester equation}
$$
AXB-CX^\star D=E,
$$
with $\star$ being either the transpose or the conjugate transpose, has attracted some attention within the linear algebra community.

In this talk, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of solution of homogeneous systems of generalized Sylvester and $\star$-Sylvester equations, namely
$$
A_iX_{\alpha_i}^{s_i}B_i-C_iX_{\beta_i}^{t_i}D_i=0,\qquad i=1,\hdots,r,
$$
with $s_i,t_i\in\{1,\star\}$. 

We focus on the case where the system has the same number of equations and unknowns (namely, $r$), and where all coefficient matrices (and unknowns) are square and with the same size."

We used this course for 6 academic years in a first-year Linear Algebra course for engineers.
16,Tanay,Saha,Contributed talk,"Computing the nearest structured non-prime polynomial matrix: theory, algorithms, and numerical approaches","We first address the problem of computing the nearest non-prime polynomial matrix to a given left-prime polynomial matrix, without imposing structural constraints. This problem extends the classical task of finding the nearest non-coprime polynomials to a set of coprime polynomials. Our approach begins by establishing the equivalence between the left-primeness property of a polynomial matrix and the rank deficiency of a specific block Toeplitz matrix derived from the polynomial matrix. By leveraging this equivalence, we reformulate the problem as finding the nearest Structured Low-Rank Approximation (SLRA) to the associated block Toeplitz matrix, with a particular focus on cases where the leading coefficient matrix of the left-prime polynomial matrix has full row rank.

We further generalize the problem to compute a non-prime matrix that is as close as possible to a given left-prime polynomial matrix while preserving a predefined structural form. In this setting, the problem is again recast as computing the nearest SLRA of a structured matrix in case of full rank leading coefficient matrix. For computing SLRA, we employ numerical techniques such as the STLN method and regularized factorization, both of which are well-documented in the literature.

Additionally, we prove that it is possible to approximate a left-prime polynomial matrix with a rank-deficient leading coefficient matrix by a non-prime polynomial matrix, without adhering to the underlying structure. For cases involving structured coefficient matrices, we reformulate the problem as a constrained optimization task. By applying numerical optimization methods, we solve this optimization problem effectively.

Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm with several numerical examples and compare the results with existing approaches in the literature wherever possible."
17,Luis Miguel,Anguas Márquez,Contributed talk,New approaches to the solutions of bispectral problems,"A family of polynomials is a solution to a bispectral problem if it forms a sequence of eigenfunctions of both a finite-order differential operator $L$ and a difference operator $J$. In 1929, S. Bochner studied the case where the differential operator is of order $2$, identifying the sequences of classical orthogonal polynomials as solutions to the bispectral problem. Since then, several contributions have been made to the study of the bispectral problem, but the case of arbitrary order remains open.

The aim of this talk is to present new tools that have helped us obtain results on whether certain differential operators produce sequences of eigenpolynomials that solve the bispectral problem. We will draw examples of such differential operators from the existing literature on bispectral problems."
18,Shivani,Goel,MS21: Linear algebra techniques in graph theory,Resistance distance in directed graphs,"Let $G=(V, E)$ be a strongly connected and balanced digraph with vertex set $V={1,\dotsc,n}$. The Laplacian matrix of $G$ is then the matrix (not necessarily symmetric) $L:=D-A$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ and $D$ is the diagonal matrix such that the row sums and the column sums of $L$ are equal to zero.
Let $L^{\dag}=[l^{\dag}_{ij}]$ be the Moore-Penrose inverse of $L$.
We define the resistance between any two vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$ by $r_{ij}:=l^{\dag}_{ii}+l^{\dag}_{jj}-2l^{\dag}_{ij}$.
Some interesting properties of the resistance and the corresponding resistance matrix $[r_{ij}]$ will be discussed in the talk.

The classical distance $d_{ij}$ between any two vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$ is the minimum length of all the
directed paths joining $i$ and $j$.
Numerical examples show that
the resistance distance between $i$ and $j$ is always less than or equal to the classical distance, i.e.
$r_{ij} \leq d_{ij}$. However, no proof of this inequality is known. In the talk, we will show that this inequality holds for all directed cactus graphs. This is a joint work with Dr. R. Balaji and Professor R. B. Bapat.

19,Jenny,Salinasan,MS31: Matrix decompositions and applications,The $\phi_S$ polar decomposition when $S$ is skew-symmetric,"Let $F$ be a field with characteristic not equal to $2$, and $S \in M_{2n}(F)$ be skew-symmetric $(S^{\top}=-S)$ and nonsingular.
Let $\phi_S$ be the function defined by $\phi_S(A)=S^{-1}A^{\top}S$ for all $A \in M_{2n}(F)$.
Suppose $A \in M_{2n}(F)$.
We say that $A$ is $\phi_S$-orthogonal if $A$ is nonsingular and $\phi_S(A)=A^{-1}$; and $A$ is $\phi_S$-symmetric if $\phi_S(A)=A$.
We say that $A$ has a $\phi_S$ polar decomposition if $A=XY$ for some $\phi_S$-orthogonal $X \in M_{2n}(F)$ and $\phi_S$-symmetric $Y \in M_{2n}(F)$.
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an $X \in M_{2n}(F)$ to have a $\phi_S$ polar decomposition."
20,Eloise,Misa,MS31: Matrix decompositions and applications,The algebra generated by nilpotent elements in a matrix centralizer,"For an arbitrary square matrix $S$, denote by $C(S)$ the centralizer of $S$, and by $C(S)_N$ the set of all nilpotent elements in $C(S)$.
In this paper, we use the Weyr canonical form to study the subalgebra $\mathcal{A}(S)$ of $C(S)$ generated by $C(S)_N$. We give a necessary and/or sufficient condition such that $A \in C(S)$ is a sum or product of nilpotent matrices in $C(S)$. We determine conditions on $S$ such that $C(S)_N$ is a subalgebra of $C(S)$, that is, when $\mathcal{A}(S)=C(S)_N$. We also determine conditions on $S$ such that the subalgebra generated by $C(S)_N$ is $C(S)$, that is, when $\mathcal{A}(S)=C(S)$."
21,Juan Paolo,Santos,MS31: Matrix decompositions and applications,On commutators of unipotent matrices of index $2$,"A commutator of unipotent matrices of index $2$ is a matrix of the form $XYX^{-1}Y^{-1}$, where $X$ and $Y$ are unipotent matrices of index $2$, that is, $X \ne I_n$, $Y \ne I_n$, and $(X-I_n)^2=(Y-I_n)^2=0_n$. If $n>2$ and $\mathbb{F}$ is a field with $|\mathbb{F}| \geq 4$, then it is shown that every $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}$ with determinant $1$ is a product of at most four commutators of unipotent matrices of index $2$. Consequently, every $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}$ with determinant $1$ is a product of at most eight unipotent matrices of index $2$. Conditions on $\mathbb{F}$ are given that improve the upper bound on the commutator factors from four to three or two. The situation for $n=2$ is also considered. This study reveals a connection between factorability into commutators of unipotent matrices and properties of $\mathbb{F}$ such as its characteristic or its set of perfect squares."
22,Roksana,Słowik,Contributed talk,Products of infinite upper triangular matrices that satisfy fixed polynomial equation,"There is plenty of results concerning representation elements of an algebraic structure, mainly a group, as products of elements possessing some particular properties. In the matrix groups one of the most famous one is being an involution. The famous theorem states that every square matrix with determinant $\pm 1$ defined over a field is a product of at most four involutions. Simply by their definition, the involutions satisfy equation $x^2-1=0$, i.e. a quadratic equation. Hence, it is natural to raise a question does a similar result hold for matrices that satisfy some other fixed quadratic equation.
\par
Consider a field $F$ and an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ defined over $F$. Define polynomial $q$ by the formula $q(x)=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$, where $a_2 \neq 0$. If element $a \in \mathcal{A}$ satisfies $q(a)=0$, then we say that $a$ is quadratic with respect to $q(x)$, or shortly that $a$ is $q(x)$-quadratic.
Recently, Bien et al. \cite{bi_ta_tr_tr} proved that every $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ upper triangular matrix whose diagonal entries are of the form $\lambda_1^{s_i}\lambda_2^{t_i}$, where $s_i+t_i=k$ for every $i \in \mathbb{N}$, $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2 \neq 0$, can be expressed as a product of at most $k$ quadratic matrices with respect to $q_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2}(x)=(x-\lambda_1)(x-\lambda_2)$.
This result brings up further questions. Does the same claim holds when $\lambda_1\lambda_2=0$? Does it also hold when we replace the quadratic polynomial by a polynomial of degree $n$ ($\ngeqslant 3$)? During this talk we are going to discuss these issues.

23,Sirshendu,Pan,Contributed talk,Universal winner in trees,"Let $A \in M_n$ be nonnegative, irreducible and $E_{ii}=e_ie_i^t$, where $e_i$ is the $i$-th standard basis vector. For a fixed $t_0>0$, an index $p \in [n]:={1,2,\ldots,n}$ is called a winner for $t_0$ if the spectral radius $\rho(A+t_0E_{pp})=\max\limits_{i\in [n]}\rho(A+t_0E_{ii})$. If $p$ remains a winner for each $t>0$, then it is called a universal winner. The concepts have been introduced in 1996 and studied in only a few articles till now. When $G$ is a simple connected graph (or a strongly connected digraph), the nonnegative weighted adjacency matrix $A(G)$ being irreducible, one can talk of a universal winner vertex with respect to $A(G)$. The universal winners seem to capture the graph structures well. It is known that the only connected digraph $G$ in which all vertices are universal winners with respect to all nonnegative weighted $A(G)$, is the directed cycle, thereby characterizing it. Let $U\subset [n]$ be nonempty. In a recent article, the class of directed connected graphs with vertex set $[n]$, for which only the vertices in $U$ are the universal winners with respect to all nonnegative weighted $A(G)$ was characterized, generalizing the earlier result. Many other combinatorial results exploiting the graph structure were proved establishing the importance of the study of universal winner vertices. In this article, we further the study for the class of undirected graphs, in particular for trees, with respect to only the adjacency matrix. As expected, we supply a class of trees in which no universal winner exists. More interestingly, every tree is a subtree of a tree with a unique universal winner and also a subtree of a tree without a universal winner. Trees with exactly $k>1$ universal winners are not easy to find. A construction of a class of trees with exactly $k$ universal winners is provided. Interestingly, it turns out that for any undirected connected graph $G$, the set of universal winners of $G$ and the corona $G\circ K_1$ are the same, where the later is obtained by adding a new pendent vertex to each vertex of $G$. It is also shown that if $\rho(A(G))>2$, then no vertex of degree one or two can be a universal winner. Previously, it was known that for a path $P$, the central vertices are the universal winners and as a vertex $u$ goes farther from the center, the spectral radius $\rho(A(P)+tE_{uu})$ decreases. We prove that a similar statement also holds for a grid graph."
24,Madhab,Mondal,Contributed talk,A $q$-analogue of the distance matrix of a tree with matrix weights,"A $q$-analogue of the distance matrix (called the $q$-distance matrix) of a tree was introduced in [Bapat RB, Lal AK, Pati S. A $q$-analogue of the distance matrix of a tree. Linear Algebra Appl. 2006;416(2-3):799--814]. It was formed from the distance matrix $D$ by substituting each entry $d(i,j)$ of $D$ by $1+q+\cdots+q^{d(i,j)-1}$. In this article, we consider the $q$-distance matrix of a weighted tree, where the edge weights are matrices of the same size. We deduce a formula for the determinant of the $q$-distance matrix of a tree. Subsequently, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the $q$-distance matrix to be invertible and derive an expression for the inverse whenever it exists. The expression for the inverse of the $q$-distance matrix leads us to introduce the $q$-analogue of the Laplacian matrix (named as the $q$-Laplacian matrix) for a tree with matrix weights. A formula for the determinant of the $q$-Laplacian matrix is also provided. Our results extend the existing results for the $q$-distance matrix of a weighted tree when the weights are real numbers, as well as the distance matrix of a tree with matrix weights (that can be obtained by setting $q=1$)."

By the smallest positive eigenvalue of $G$, we mean the smallest positive eigenvalue of $A(G)$, and it is denoted by $\tau(G)$. This spectral parameter has significant applications in both chemical graph theory and spectral graph theory. In the literature, the study of the smallest positive eigenvalue has primarily focused on trees, bipartite unicyclic graphs, and bipartite graphs. In this talk, we discuss bounds on the smallest positive eigenvalue of non-bipartite unicyclic graphs and characterize the extremal graphs. This talk is based on joint work with Sasmita Barik and Subhasish Behera."

Let $S_k(G)$ denote the sum of $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$ and $e(G)$ denote the number of edges in $G$. Brouwer conjectured that $S_k(G)\leq e(G)+\binom{k+1}{2}$ for any $k\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$. Let $H$ be a connected graph on $m\geq 2$ vertices. Here, we show that if $G$ and $H$ satisfy the Brouwer's conjecture, then the corona of $G$ and $H$ also satisfies the Brouwer's conjecture. Furthermore, when $G$ is regular, $n\geq 4$, $m\geq 3$ and $e(H)\geq m+1$, we prove that if $H$ satisfies the Brouwer's conjecture, then the edge corona of $G$ and $H$ also satisfies the Brouwer's conjecture.

27,Iswar,Mahato,Contributed talk,A generalized class of matrices associated to threshold and chain graphs,"Motivated by the distance matrix $D(G)$ of a connected graph $G$, we define a new class of matrix $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \delta}(G)$ of a connected graph $G$ with diameter at most $3$, by substituting the entries $0,1,2$ and $3$ of $D(G)$ by the real variables $\alpha,\beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$, respectively. Clearly, by putting suitable values of $\alpha,\beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$, we get six interesting known matrices, such as adjacency matrix, Seidel matrix, distance matrix, squared distance matrix, $q$-distance matrix and exponential distance matrix. Therefore, for a graph $G$ with diameter at most $3$, the matrix $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \delta}(G)$ generalizes these six known matrices. In this article, we consider $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}(G)$ of a threshold graph $G$ and determine an eigenvalue free-interval for $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}(G)$. As a consequence of this result, we recover the known results about the eigenvalue free-interval of the adjacency matrix, the Seidel matrix and the distance matrix of a threshold graph, respectively and obtain an eigenvalue free-interval for the squared distance matrix, the $q$-distance matrix and the exponential distance matrix of a threshold graph, respectively. Moreover, we give an explicit expression for the characteristic polynomial of $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}(G)$. Furthermore, we consider $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \delta}(G)$ of a chain graph $G$ and find the characteristic polynomial of  $D_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma, \delta}(G)$. As a consequence of these results, we give a determinant formula for the distance matrix, the squared distance matrix, the $q$-distance matrix and the exponential distance matrix of a threshold graph and a chain graph, respectively.

28,Damjana,Kokol Bukovšek,Contributed talk,Compressed commuting graphs of matrix rings,"In the talk we introduce compressed commuting graph of rings. It can be seen as a compression of the standard commuting graph (with the central elements added) where we identify the vertices that generate the same subring. The compression is chosen in such a way that it induces a functor from the category of rings to the category of graphs, which means that our graph takes into account not only the commutativity relation in the ring, but also the commutativity relation in all of its homomorphic images. 

We show that this compression is best possible for matrix algebras over finite fields. We consider the compressed commuting graphs of finite fields, rings of $2 \times 2$ matrices over finite fields and rings of $3 \times 3$ matrices over finite prime fields.

29,Dario Andrea,Bini,Plenary talk,Matrix structures in queueing and network models: An overview,"We provide an overview of some results concerning classes of matrices involved in queueing and network models. We show specific examples where the analysis of matrix structures, besides providing a better understanding of the original problem, is a fundamental step in designing effective ad hoc solution algorithms.

Two specific issues are considered:  the analysis of random walks on a regular grid in the quarter plane, and the assessment of the centrality of the edges in a graph. Both issues derive from the analysis of relevant real-world problems and are modeled by Markov chains describing random walks on a graph. 

In the first topic, the graph is a regular grid, and the specific features of the problem lead to semi-infinite transition probability matrices with a two-level tridiagonal and almost Toeplitz structure. We show that these matrices live in a suitable infinite-dimensional structured matrix algebra which is also a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. This fact will be crucial to designing effective fast algorithms for computing the steady-state vector of the associated Markov chain.

In the second topic, the graph is typically a road map of a city or region. Thus, the Toeplitz structure of the associated transition probability matrix is lost. However, the sparsity and band structure of this matrix will allow us to easily compute a centrality measure of the edges defined in terms of Kemeny's constant of the associated Markov chain. The effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithms is tested on the road maps of Pisa and Tuscany.

30,Anjali,Beniwal,Contributed talk,Computation of an exact and approximate GCRD of several polynomial matrices using generalized Sylvester matrices,"The computation of an exact and approximate Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of polynomial matrices is a fundamental problem in control theory and signal processing. While extensive research has been conducted on the Greatest Common Divisors (GCDs) of scalar polynomials, the study of GCRDs in polynomial matrices remains relatively limited. It is important to develop fast and reliable ways to compute both exact and approximate GCRD, especially when dealing with approximate cases where the data is corrupted by noise.\\
We address the problem of computing both exact and approximate GCRDs for a given set of univariate polynomial matrices $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$. We establish a key theoretical result—proving that the rank deficiency of a particular generalized Sylvester matrix associated with $P(s)$, where $P(s)$ is obtained by stacking $B_1(s), \dots, B_t(s)$ one below the other, corresponds to the degree of the determinant of their GCRD. This equivalence enables us to develop efficient algorithms for computing an exact GCRD using \textit{Effectively Eliminating QR} (EEQR) decomposition and $SVD$ of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix. $SVD$ can handle noise-corrupted data, making it particularly effective for computing an approximate GCRD. This approach leverages the numerical rank of that particular generalized Sylvester matrix to estimate the degree of an approximate GCRD. Both algorithms are simple to develop, easy to understand, and convenient to implement, ensuring scalability.\\
We validate our results through various numerical examples, demonstrating their effectiveness. These findings have significant implications for applications requiring polynomial matrix factorizations and simplifications in the presence of noise and uncertainty."

Moreover, such $g$ is \emph{strongly reversible} if $s$ is an involution, i.e., $s^2 = e$ where $e$ is the identity of the group $G$. In this talk, we study the reversibility problem in the group of invertible matrices over real quaternions $\mathbb{H}$, $GL(n, \mathbb{H})$. We completely classify up to standard Jordan form all real quaternion matrices in $GL(n,\mathbb{H})$ that are strongly reversible."

34,Rafik,Bouifden,MS29: Matrix functions and related topics,The expansion of functions by Toeplitz matrices,"The expansion of a real function is a crucial technique for representing a function as an infinite series of simpler functions. This method serves as the primary tool for locally approximating functions that cannot be expressed solely through basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—using polynomials.
To grasp the significance of this mathematical concept, historical and epistemological research is essential, as noted by Sierpinska $[1]$. The notion of expansion has evolved through several stages, reflecting the development of a broad conceptual framework. R. Kouki $[2]$ categorizes these stages into five non-linear steps, which incorporate various geometric, analytical, and algebraic techniques. The groundwork for this work was laid in the early seventeenth century by mathematicians such as Torricelli, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, and Isaac Barrow, who addressed tangent problems. This was further articulated by Taylor in 1715 and later expanded upon by Newton and Leibniz through polynomial methods, with significant contributions from Cauchy in 1823 and Abel in 1826, culminating in Poincar\'e's work in 1886.
Today, calculating the expansion of a function often requires divisions based on increasing powers, where approximate reasoning involves neglecting certain terms in this limiting process. In this context, we propose a novel algorithmic matrix technique that leverages the fundamental properties of matrix computations. Specifically, we associate the expansion of a function $f$ to order $n$ near zero with a Toeplitz triangular matrix, where the first column represents the polynomial corresponding to the expansion of $f$. We then outline all calculation rules for these limited developments. Ultimately, our work gives a quick algorithm to find, according to Douady $[3]$ the object ``the expansion'' of non-usual functions, whose Toeplitz matrices we have chosen as a ``tool'' and vice
versa in some cases. This approach highlights the importance of matrix techniques in advancing our understanding and application of function expansions.

36,Daniel,Kressner,Plenary talk,Adaptive randomized pivoting,"Finding good subsets of row and column indices, often called pivots, is a ubiquitous task in applied and numerical linear algebra. One of its most famous appearances is arguably in Gaussian elimination for solving linear systems, where a good choice of pivots is crucial for numerical stability. This talk will focus on pivoting in the context of low-dimensional approximation, including column subset selection, discrete empirical interpolation, and various interpolative decompositions, such as the CUR and Cholesky/Nystrom approximations. In all of these cases, a greedy choice of pivots usually works well but there are well-known counterexamples where such a choice leads to poor results. We present a new randomized pivot selection strategy that avoids such unfavorable worst-case performance by using adaptivity in two senses: It adapts to information on the range / co-range of a matrix, and the sampling distribution is updated after each pivot selection. Adaptive randomized pivoting enjoys error guarantees that match, in expectation, the best known existence results. At the same time, it is   simpler and usually cheaper than volume-based techniques, which achieve similar guarantees through volume sampling or iterative local volume maximization. We will illustrate several applications of adaptive randomized pivoting and discuss derandomized variants. This talk is based on joint work with Alice Cortinovis, University of Pisa."

Token graphs have applications in coding theory and quantum mechanics. It was conjectured that for any graph $G$, the algebraic connectivity of $F_k(G)$ is equal to the algebraic connectivity of $G$. This result turned out to be a theorem, as it was proved by using the theory of the continuous Markov chain of random walks and interchange process. However, proving this theorem using algebraic and combinatorial methods is still an open and interesting problem. In this talk, we discuss the algebraic connectivity and Laplacian spectral radius of token graphs. Moreover, we study the Laplacian integral token graphs.

39,Smrati,Pandey,Contributed talk,Spectral properties of the eccentricity matrix of graph products,"Let $G$ be a connected and simple graph. The eccentricity of a vertex $u \in G$, $(e(u))$, is defined as the maximum distance from $u$ to any other vertex $v \in G$ in the graph. The eccentricity matrix, $\epsilon(G)$ is derived from the distance matrix whose $(u, v)$-th entry is equal to $d(u, v)$ if $d(u, v)$ is the minimum of $\{e(u), e(v)\}$, and is zero otherwise. Note that $d(u, v)$ is the distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$. A graph $G$ is said to be self centered if the eccentricity of each vertex of $G$ is same. 

The corona product is a prominent graph operation known for its distinct structural features and has been the focus of extensive research. Over the time, several variations of the corona product have been introduced and analyzed.

Assume that $G$ and $H$ are two finite graphs on $m$ and $n$ vertices, respectively. The corona product $G \circ H$ of two graphs $G$ and $H$, is constructed by keeping a single copy of $G$ and $m$ copies of $H$, and then connecting each vertex of the $j$-th copy of $H$ to the $j$-th vertex of $G$. The one-point-corona, denoted as $G \circ_z H$, is constructed similarly by taking one copy of $H$ for each vertex of $G$, but only the the root vertex $z$ from each copy of $H$ is connected to corresponding vertex in $G$ with an edge.

In this talk, we discuss the irreducibility and spectra of eccentricity matrices obtained from the  corona product and the one point corona product of graphs $G$ and $H$, where $G$ is a self-centered graph."

For any $T \in \mathcal{B(H)}$, 
a generalization of the classical numerical range, namely $q$-numerical range was introduced by Marcus and Andresen in 1977 on $n$- dimensional unitary space. In 1984, the convexity of $q$-numerical range was proved by Nam-Kiu Tsing. The $q$-numerical range of $T \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is defined by 
\[
W_q(T)=\{ \langle Tx,y \rangle: x,y \in H, \|x\|=\|y\|=1, \langle x,y \rangle=q \}.

\[

\]
We introduce and examine the concept of the $q$-numerical range, namely, $q$-joint numerical range, for $n$-tuples of bounded linear operators in Hilbert spaces. We derive several inequalities related to the $q$-numerical radius of these operator tuples. Furthermore, we present a generalization of the $q$-numerical range of an operator $T \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ within the context of semi-Hilbertian spaces. Initially, we established the convexity properties of the $q$-numerical range within semi-Hilbertian space, followed by an examination of its relationship with the spectrum in the same context. We have derived several numerical-radius inequalities for the $q$-numerical radius in semi-Hilbertian space, which generalize numerous existing inequalities in the literature.

In particular, Tucker decomposition has emerged as a tool for modeling multi-dimensional data, helping to uncover underlying patterns, especially in the presence of missing data. In this study, we leverage Tucker decomposition for the completion of motion capture (MoCap) data, which is inherently multi-dimensional and characterized by complex temporal dependencies. MoCap data often suffers from gaps due to missing markers during the recording process, leading to the need for efficient and accurate gap-filling methods. We propose two gap-filling algorithms based on Tucker decomposition: Tucker and TuckerTNN. These methods exploit the low-rank properties of MoCap tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with traditional smoothness regularization, we introduce a temporal nuclear norm regularization in the TuckerTNN model, which provides a more efficient solution for large-scale MoCap datasets. We evaluate the proposed algorithms using the publicly available HDM05 MoCap dataset."

Reduced biquaternions are a four-dimensional commutative number algebra, introduced by Segre in 1892.

","An element of a group is called an involution if its square equals the identity element. Decomposing a group element into a product of involutions has applications in various areas of mathematics, with a particular focus on elements that can be expressed as the product of two involutions, known as \textit{strongly reversible}, \textit{strongly real}, or \textit{bireflectional} elements. Classifying strongly reversible elements in a group is a problem of broad interest. It is known that an element of the general linear group over a field is strongly reversible if and only if it is similar to its inverse. However, this result does not hold for special linear groups over a field or a division ring. In this talk, we will use the notion of reversibility to classify the strongly reversible elements in the complex special linear group and the quaternionic special linear group.

On the other hand, traditional methods for solving chaotic and highly non-linear systems face challenges in computational efficiency due to their inherent complexity and dynamics. Fortunately, neural networks excel in solving highly non-linear systems, showing exceptional performance.

In this talk, we propose a neural network approach to update the states of dynamical systems through a structured operator known as a Hankel operator -- an operator characterized by a Hankel structure. Our goal is to develop an optimal, low-complexity learning algorithm that utilizes time-delay measurements to forecast future states effectively. By the conclusion of the talk, we will demonstrate how this operator can be employed to model state-space dynamical systems, enabling predictions and insights into future dynamics compared to conventional techniques: SINDy and HAVOK followed by the feedforward neural networks.

 "," A non-negative square matrix is called a doubly stochastic (DS) matrix if all its row and column sums are exactly equal to $1.$ A vast literature is known for such matrices concerning the eigenvalue region, inverse eigenvalue problem or entry-wise distribution of the non-negative numbers when matrix size or order of the matrix is restricted up to $4,$
 whereas only a little is known for matrices of order $5$ or more except for some sets of doubly structured matrices. 
 %A DS matrix always can be represented as the convex combination of permutation matrices of concerned size.
 
 This talk concerns the following questions: What are those trace zero order $5$ DS matrices whose $k$-times multiplications are also trace zero matrices for some values of $k?$ What is the eigenvalue region of the set of trace zero order $5$ DS matrices? 
 
 We address these questions by proposing a graph theoretic approach to determine the trace of the product of two permutation matrices through a weighted digraph representation for a pair of permutation matrices. Then, we derive the DS matrices of order $5$ whose $k$-th power is also a trace-zero DS matrix for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$. Then, we determine necessary conditions for the coefficients of a generic polynomial of degree $5$ to be realizable as the characteristic polynomial of a trace-zero DS matrix of order $5$. Using this, we approximate the eigenvalue region of trace-zero DS matrices of order $5.$

62,Shakir Showkat,Sofi,MS8: Tensor and quantum information science,Tensor train completion of multiway data observed in a single mode,"Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a partially observed data tensor by leveraging the observations and the pattern of observation. Completion is more important for tensors than for matrices for several reasons. Higher-order datasets are larger, increasing the likelihood of missing or unreliable entries. Large-scale data often exhibits low-rank properties (intuitively, not every entry is ``equally important,'' unlike in smaller matrices). Many interesting problems can be framed as instances of low-rank tensor completion, including image and video recovery, collaborative filtering, and quantum state tomography \cite{liu2013tc, gross2010quantum}. Low-rank tensor completion is generally solved via convex optimization techniques. Current theories concerning these methods often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements \cite{candes2009exact, liu2013tc}. However, if an observation pattern has some structure, more efficient algorithms can be developed by leveraging the structure.\par

Algebraic methods exploit the low-rank structure to design algorithms that rely solely on standard numerical linear algebra (NLA) operations. They are fast and are guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. In this line, a specific type of ``fiber-wise'' observation pattern has been discussed, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. This observation is interesting because it appears in many real-life applications and highlights a key difference between matrices and tensors. While missing fibers (rows or columns) in a matrix make completion underdetermined, higher-order tensors can still be completed even if some fibers are entirely missing along one mode. It has been shown that under reasonable conditions, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and multilinear singular value decomposition (MLSVD) of such an incomplete tensor can still be obtained using only standard NLA \cite{mikael2019fibersamp, stijn2023mlsvdfsj}. Note that there is an important difference with the technique of cross or skeleton approximation in the sense that we assume the availability of fibers in one mode only. \par

With the increasing prevalence of big data, the demand for reliable and scalable algorithms has become more pressing. The tensor train (TT) decomposition is stable and can break the curse of dimensionality \cite{oseledets2010tensortrain}. This talk shows how to extend the fiber-wise completion to the TT format. We discuss the deterministic conditions under which the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed \cite{stijn2023mlsvdfsj, shakir2024ttfw}. Furthermore, we discuss a few interesting applications and briefly highlight the possibility of utilizing this tensor completion framework as a fundamental experimental primitive for efficient quantum state tomography with fewer measurements.

64,Miguel,Rojas Rodríguez,Contributed talk,Matrix analysis of orthogonal polynomials and uvarov perturbations,"In this talk, we emphasize the decisive role of matrix analysis in studying orthogonal polynomials. The theory of classical orthogonal polynomials and matrix analysis naturally arises in the study of tridiagonal matrices (Jacobi matrices), whose spectrum, under certain conditions, coincides with the support of a measure associated with a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. Furthermore, the GaussâBorel factorization of the moment matrix plays a fundamental role in characterizing orthogonality and uncovering key structural properties. \\
We focus on MMOP, which are orthogonal polynomials with respect to a matrix of measures. In this case, the associated Jacobi matrix is a banded matrix, where the number of nonzero diagonals depends on the size of the measure. Within this framework, we study how orthogonal polynomials transform when the matrix of measures undergoes matrix polynomial perturbations. The most general perturbation we consider follows Uvarovâs form:   \\
    $ \mathrm{d}\tilde{\mu}(x) R(x) = L(x) \mathrm{d} \mu(x),$\\
where $R(x),\,L(x)$ are polynomial matrices, $\mathrm{d} \mu (x)$ is the original measure matrix, and $\mathrm{d} \tilde{\mu}(x)$ is the perturbed measure matrix. By taking $R(x) = I$ or $L(x) = I$, we obtain a Christoffel or Geronimus perturbation, respectively.   \\
The main contribution of our work is the generalization of these perturbations beyond diagonal matrix polynomials, extending the theory to include cases with non-monic leading matrices. This generalization leads to an analysis of the spectral properties of the perturbation matrix polynomials. Furthermore, we reduce the problem of ensuring orthogonalityâframed as a question of the quasi-definiteness of a matrix measureâto a linear algebra problem involving the compatibility of certain systems of linear equations."

In an application-oriented manner, it presents theories to significantly improve critical computational performance and thus aims at a fast implementation for impact-angle-constrained interception of agile maneuvering targets. More specifically, regarding the two major computational burdens using SDDRE, we have replaced the burden in numerical applicability checking by a simple, equivalent, and closed-form condition for the entire state space, which is actually the dominant burden as supported by complexity analysis and extensive validations. Notably, the proposed analysis not only complements the early findings of applicability guarantee in literature, but also promotes the efficiency of the proposed philosophy when compared to the classic method, where the latter has caused concerns/reservations due to its feasibility and difficulty. On the other hand, we have largely mitigated the second major burden of SDDRE by -- after exhaustive trials -- selecting the most efficient Riccati-equation solver until the latest benchmarks.

We propose a method for finding a globally optimal \( k \)-partition in the general case (\( n \)-dimensional data, \( n > 1 \)), extending an approach originally designed for solving Lipschitz global optimization for symmetric functions. Our method integrates a global optimization algorithm with linear constraints and the \( k \)-means algorithm. The global optimization component is used solely to generate a high-quality initial approximation for \( k \)-means.

a_{ji}},$ for all $i,j=1,\ldots ,n.$ If, in addition, $a_{ik}a_{kj}=a_{ij}$ for
all $i,j,k,$ the matrix is said to be consistent. Such a matrix is of the
form $ww^{(-T)}$ for some positive vector $w$, in which $w^{(-T)}$ is the transpose of the entrywise
inverse of $w$.

PC matrices play an important role in decision making, namely in models for ranking
alternatives, as the Analytic Hierarchy Process,  proposed by Saaty (1977). 
In these models, a PC matrix represents independent, pairwise, ratio
comparisons among $n$ alternatives and a cardinal ranking vector should be
obtained from it. The consistent matrix constructed from this vector should
be a good approximation of the PC matrix. So, it is desirable to choose a
ranking vector from the set of efficient vectors, as, otherwise, there would
be a positive vector such that the consistent matrix constructed from it
better approximates the PC matrix in at least one entry and is not worse in
all other entries. 

It is known that a positive vector $w$ is efficient for a PC matrix $A$ if
and only if a certain directed graph associated with $A$ and $w$ is strongly
connected. Based on this result, here we give a description of the set of
efficient vectors for a PC matrix as a union of a finite number of
convex sets and discuss some of its consequences. In particular, tight lower
and upper bound matrices for the consistent matrix constructed from an
efficient vector are given.

A common characteristic of many ``real-world'' graphs is a degree distribution that follows an inverse power law. Specifically, the number of vertices with degree $x$ is proportional to $x^\beta$, where $\beta$ typically ranges between 1 and 3. The Chung-Lu model offers a straightforward approach to capturing this power-law behavior in synthetic networks.

We extend the Chung-Lu model to random geometric graphs. In this extension, each vertex is assigned both an expected degree and a random position in Euclidean space according to a probability distribution. Once the vertices are placed, the realization of each edge occurs independently of others. We rigorously establish the conditions necessary to ensure that the assigned degrees align with the expected degrees. This geometric Chung-Lu model is tested on the connectome of the \emph{Drosophila} medulla (fruit fly), where the random model successfully replicates the graph-theoretical structure of the original network, including the eigenvalues of various graph-theoretic matrices.

Blue vertices can ``force'' a white neighbor to become blue if all other  neighbors are blue. The goal is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices to eventually force all vertices blue after exhaustively applying the forcing rule above.
Leaky forcing is a fault-tolerant variation of zero forcing where certain vertices (not necessarily initially blue) cannot force. The goal in this context is to find the minimum number of initially blue vertices needed that can eventually force all vertices to be blue, {\it regardless} of which small number of vertices can't force.

This work extends results from zero forcing in terms of leaky forcing. New results regarding leaky forcing presented here include:

\item Complete determination of all leaky forcing numbers for all unicyclic graphs.
\item Robust upper bounds for generalized Petersen graphs.
\item Bounds for the effect of both edge removal and vertex removal.

83,Kshitij,Sharma,Contributed talk,"Combinatorial description of the inverse of the adjacency matrix of non-bipartite bicyclic graphs
","Barik et al. [On nonsingular trees and a reciprocal eigenvalue property, Linear Multilinear Algebra, 54(6)(2006) 453-465] provided a combinatorial description of the inverse of the adjacency matrix for bipartite graphs in terms of $mm$-alternating paths, enabling deeper exploration of bipartite graph properties. However, for non-bipartite graphs, a similar framework remained an open challenge. In 2022, a combinatorial description was established for non-bipartite unicyclic graphs.
This paper advances the understanding of non-bipartite graphs by providing a comprehensive combinatorial description of the inverse of the adjacency matrix for non-bipartite bicyclic graphs, utilizing $mm$-alternating paths between vertices. It further determines the conditions under which the adjacency matrix of a bicyclic graph is unimodular and establishes criteria for the adjacency matrix of a non-bipartite graph to be signable. Additionally, it is definitively shown that the inverse graph of a non-bipartite bicyclic graph remains non-bipartite, reinforcing the structural properties of such graphs.

The graph $\Gamma$ exhibits pretty good fractional revival (PGFR) between the vertices $a$ and $b$ if there exists a sequence $\{t_k\}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\lim_{k\to\infty} H(t_k){\textbf{e}_{a}} = \alpha{\textbf{e}_{a}} + \beta{\textbf{e}_{b}}$, where $\alpha, \beta(\neq 0) \in \mathbb{C}$ with $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$. In particular, if $\alpha = 0$, then $\Gamma$ exhibits pretty good state transfer (PGST) between $a$ and $b$. In this study, we first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of PGFR on Cayley graphs over abelian groups. Using that necessary and sufficient condition, we prove that complement of a cycle on $2 p^s$ vertices, where $p$ is an odd prime and $s$ is a positive integer, exhibits PGFR.  In the class of unitary Cayley graphs, we prove that an unitary Cayley graph on $n$ ($n \geq 8$) vertices exhibits PGFR if and only if $n = 2p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. The preceding two classes of circulant graphs provide infinitely many circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR that fails to exhibits PGST. Further we obtain more circulant graphs exhibiting PGFR. We also obtain some classes of circulant graphs not exhibiting PGFR. Some of our results generalize the results of Chan et al.

Parametric regression risks model misspecification, while nonparametric regression suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) regression provides a flexible alternative, summarizing covariate effects through a few linear combinations without imposing a specific functional form. While SDR methods have been extensively studied, coordinate testing, which assesses the contribution of a set of linear combinations of covariates, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel method that transforms the coordinate testing problem into a dimension testing problem by applying appropriate residualization. Since dimension tests are well-established, this method allows practitioners to leverage existing inference tools within the SDR framework.

101,Nikolai,Krivulin,Contributed talk,"An alternating algorithm for tropical best discrete approximation
","We consider a best discrete approximation problem in the setting of tropical (idempotent) algebra dealing with the theory and application of semirings and semifields with idempotent operations. Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator in the function. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the given data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides with one side answered to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side of the equation involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials in the corresponding polynomial. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternatively fixing one side of the equation to the already found result and leaving the other intact. The obtained equation is first approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which results in a vector of coefficients and approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. Furthermore, the values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, using an optimization procedure that is based on an agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate applications, we present results for approximation problems formulated in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which correspond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonably good solution to approximation problems considered.

Many numerical algorithms have been developed to find the efficient solution of the {SPP}  with {{circulant}}, {Toeplitz}, or {symmetric}-{Toeplitz} block matrices. This prompts a natural inquiry: can an approximate solution obtained from a numerical algorithm be the exact solution to a nearly perturbed problem? The concept of backward error ({BE})  is used to determine how far a computed solution stands from the original problem. Recent research efforts have focused on exploring the  BE for SPPs.

In our setting, the matrices \(A_n\) are composed of (block rectangular) Toeplitz blocks defined by rectangular \(s \times t\) matrix-valued generating functions, and can be viewed as a generalization of classical GLT (Generalized Locally Toeplitz) sequences. Under mild assumptions on the block dimensions, the asymptotic distribution of the singular values of the associated matrix sequences is recently known. Moreover, when the singular value symbol is Hermitian, the spectral symbol coincides with the singular value symbol. Starting from the tools used to determine this singular value distribution, we develop a general preconditioning framework to construct simplified block matrices that approximate the original matrices. These simplified matrices offer two key advantages:\\
1. They maintain the same singular value distributions as \(\{A_n\}_{n}\); \\
2. They enable the solution of linear systems in \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) arithmetic operations.\\

114,Nian,Shao,MS23: Advances in Krylov subspace methods and their applications,"Lanczos with compression for symmetric eigenvalue problems
","Lanczos method with implicit restarting is one of the most successful methods for finding a few eigenpairs of a large-scale symmetric matrix.
Despite its widespread use, the core approach of employing polynomial filtering for restarting has remained unchanged over the past two decades.
In this talk, we introduce a novel compression strategy, called Lanczos with compression, as an alternative to restarting.
Unlike restarting, Lanczos with compression sacrifices the Krylov structure but preserves the subsequent Lanczos sequence.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the compression introduces only a small error compared to the standard Lanczos method.
Numerical results show that, in terms of matrix-vector products, our approach is never worse and often outperforms the restarting strategy, sometimes by a significant margin.

Considerable research has been done in the last two decades around understanding how forbidding backtracking affects the random walk.  We will discuss past and current research on how forbidding backtracking affects mixing rates, hitting times, Kemeny's constant, and other aspects of random walks, and we will discuss some future directions for exploration.

117,Duc-Quoc,Huynh,Contributed talk,Nonmonotone diagonal quasi-Newton accelerated gradient descent methods for the nearest correlation matrix problems ,"The nearest correlation matrix (NCM) problem poses computational difficulties with critical implications in finance and actuarial science. Accurate correlation matrices are essential for effective risk management and investment strategies.  
The NCM problem is mathematically formulated as a constrained optimization problem, often solved using the alternating projection method (APM) or alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) . However, its slow linear convergence and required complete eigenvalue decomposition at each iteration render it computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems. Alternatively, the NCM problem can be reformulated as an unconstrained optimization task in its dual form, taking advantage of its convex structure. It allows for a focus on minimizing the dual objective function by solving for the zeros of its gradient to satisfy first-order optimality conditions. Our proposed method belongs to the framework of the generalized linesearch iterative methods, incorporating two basic elements: search direction and stepsize determination. Additionally, we introduce two practical mechanisms, including an accelerated step and nonlinear preconditioning, to improve the method's robustness and efficiency.
We proposed the quasi-Newton method with diagonal Jacobian approximation (QN-SDAJ), which is used as a nonlinear preconditioner to accelerate gradient descent, significantly reducing the number of iterations and computational time. Numerical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives, including accelerated gradient descent, semismooth inexact Newton, and APM, particularly for large-scale problems, demonstrating superior efficiency."
118,Fumio,Hiai,Plenary talk,"Various inequalities for quasi-arithmetic mean and quasi-geometric type means of matrices","Our targets in this talk are the quasi extensions of the weighted arithmetic mean and of the weighted geometric type means, including the weighted geometric mean, the weighted spectral geometric mean, the R\'enyi mean, and the Log-Euclidean mean, for positive (semi)definite matrices. For example,
\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(\alpha A^p+(1-\alpha)B^p)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the quasi-weighted arithmetic mean}, \\
&G_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=(A^p\#_\alpha B^p)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the quasi-weighted geometric mean}, \\
&R_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\bigl(B^{{1-\alpha\over2}p}A^{\alpha p}B^{{1-\alpha\over2}p}\bigr)^{1/p},
\ \mbox{the R\'enyi mean}, \\
&LE_\alpha(A,B):=\exp(\alpha\log A+(1-\alpha)\log B),
\ \mbox{the weighted Log-Euclidean mean},
\end{align*}
where $\alpha\in(0,1)$ (or all $\alpha>0$) is the weight parameter and $p>0$ is the parameter of the quasi extension.
For the quasi versions of these weighted matrix means we consider inequalities in different types of orders such as the Loewner order $\le$, the chaotic $\le_{\mathrm{ch}}$ (i.e., $\log X\le \log Y$), the near order $\le_{\mathrm{ne}}$ (i.e., $X\#Y^{-1}\le I$), the entrywise eigenvalue order $\le_\lambda$, the log-majorization $\prec_{\log}$, the weak majorization $\prec_w$, and the order under trace (i.e., $\mathrm{Tr}\,X\le\mathrm{Tr}\,Y$), whose order relations weaken in this writing order.
Our objective is to pursue under which condition of the parameters $\alpha,p,q$ the inequality $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all positive (semi)definite matrices $A,B$, for any pair $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ from the above quasi-weighted means and for any order $\triangleleft$ mentioned above.
For instance, it is shown that $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\le\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p=q$ or $1\le p<q$ or $1/2\le p<1\le q$, whereas, for any other weaker order $\triangleleft$, $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds for all $A,B\ge0$ if and only if $p\le q$. When $(\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p},\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q})$ is a pair from the quasi-weighted geometric type means, we are mostly interested in the condition of $\alpha,p,q$ under which the log-majorization $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\prec_{\log}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ holds and whether $AB=BA$ follows from the equality case $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)=\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal{N}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ in this situation."
119,Massimiliano,Fasi,"MS5: Advances in matrix equations: Theory, computations, and applications","Mixed-Precision Algorithms for the Sylvester Matrix Equation
","Modern supercomputers achieve their remarkable speeds by leveraging machine-learning hardware accelerators.
These accelerators deliver extraordinary throughput by trading off some degree of accuracy, and, to fully utilise their potential, we must rely on low-precision floating-point formats such as binary16, bfloat16, or binary8.
These reduced-precision formats can have a throughput up to two orders of magnitude higher than binary64, but they lack the precision needed for traditional scientific simulations, which require higher accuracy to yield meaningful results.
To integrate GPUs effectively into scientific computing, we must reimagine high-precision computations by strategically applying lower precision whenever feasible.

We consider techniques to solve the general Sylvester equation $AX + XB = C$ in mixed precision.
By revisiting a stationary iteration for linear systems, we derive a new iterative refinement scheme for the quasi-triangular Sylvester equation.
We then leverage this iterative scheme to solve the general Sylvester equation in mixed precision.
The new algorithms compute the Schur decomposition of the matrix coefficients in low precision, use the low-precision Schur factors to obtain an approximate solution to the quasi-triangular equation, and iteratively refine it to obtain a working-precision solution to the quasi-triangular equation.
However, being only orthonormal to low precision, the unitary Schur factors of A and B cannot be used to recover the solution to the original equation.
We propose two effective approaches to address this issue: one is based on re-orthonormalization in the working precision, and the other on explicit inversion of the almost-unitary factors.

This is joint work with Andrii Dmytryshyn, Nicholas J.~Higham, and Xiaobo Liu.
